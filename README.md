# Detector
The program takes a path to a directory as an argument and prints all files with the same content in the terminal. 
It also creates a json file with all the contents of the directory and its subdirectorys.

The program takes an absolute file path as an argument. On linux you can use the "pwd" command to get this. 
On windows you can go to properties of a file. The word "location" refers to the path to the directory the file is located in.


example run:
python detector.py "C: \ Users \ nilsolav \ Documents \ Important files"
